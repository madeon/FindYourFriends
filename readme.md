# Find Your Friends

This project was developed by Mathias Gundertofte (magun15) and Alexander Gehling (algeh15) as part of the Android Programming elective course.

## The project idea

The idea of the project, was to create an application that makes it easier to find your friends at festivals and other events where it is easy to get lost.

## How to use the application

You start out by creating a user and logging in. When you are logged in, you can either choose to create your own group or to join one of your friends group.
If you create your own group, you have to give it a name and then a unique code will be generated for you to share with your friends.
When a friend wants to join your group, he/she must enter your code in "Join group".
When 2 or more persons are in the same group, they will be able to see each others positions on the map in real-time.
